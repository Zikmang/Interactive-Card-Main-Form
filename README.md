# Interactive Card Details Form

## About
This project is a pixel-perfect implementation of a credit card payment form. The primary goal was to create an interactive experience where the credit card visual updates in real-time as the user types, complete with specific input masking (e.g., auto-spacing numbers) and strict validation.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Visualization:** The card graphic mirrors user input instantly.
- **Input Masking:** Automatically formats the card number (adds spaces every 4 digits) and limits character length.
- **Form Validation:** Checks for blank fields, wrong formats (numbers only), and date validity.
- **Completed State:** A success message is displayed upon valid submission.
- **Responsive Layout:** Adapts from a mobile-first column layout to a desktop split-screen design.
